### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 is one of my favorites because I believe its important. It let down a foundation to how the class is going to work. Before deeply comprehending and completely understanding how a specific language works, printing hello world is a mandatory, iconic introduction. Additionally, this is how the class was introduced to cloning, adding, commiting, and pushing. 

* Lab 8

    Another one of my favorites is lab 8. Although it was not the first time we were able to set boundaries with user-input, lab 8, part 1 enabled students to lead the user to produce a proper answer that is valid. Not only that, it was also interesting to learn how to assign different variables to different arguments. 

* Lab 10

    My last favorite is Lab 10. A crucial component to coding is being able to access and use tables just like we did in lab 10. This specific lab also set a boundary for users to supply the program with a valid answer that aligns with what is in the table.
